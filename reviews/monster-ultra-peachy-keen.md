Monster Ultra Peachy Keen is a bold peach-forward zero-sugar energy drink with a candy-sweet bite.  
It pours with a light golden hue and moderate fizz, reminiscent of peach soda but packs a decent caffeine kick.  
The sweetness can feel a bit synthetic, but it’s balanced enough to keep sipping. Bonus points for can design.

**Flavor Notes**: Peach candy, slight tea-like bitterness  
**Design Rating**: 🍑🍑🍑🍑/5
